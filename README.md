## Coding Project: Client Management Dashboard Using React

A sleek and responsive client management dashboard built over an hour with **React** and modern component-based design. This application allows users to add new clients, filter them by industry, and view all client data in a sortable, mobile-friendly table. Key features and skills demonstrated include:

- State management and lifecycle control with `useState` and `useEffect`
- Dynamic form handling for adding new clients
- Real-time filtering of clients by industry, with filter options generated from current data
- Responsive, accessible UI using custom CSS and media queries
- Modular architecture with reusable components (`App`, `AddClientForm`, `IndustryFilter`, `ClientList`)
- Clean, professional design with consistent theming and drop shadows
- The ability to work under pressure and within significant time constraints

The dashboard is ideal for showcasing CRUD operations, controlled components, and responsive design best practices in a React environment. A next step for this project would be to hook it into a PostgreSQL database.
